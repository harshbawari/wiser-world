WISER WORLD\u2019S purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how WW\u2019s visitors use its website. From time to time, WISER WORLD may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">WW also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/wisersworld.in\/\">https:\/\/www.wiserworld.in<\/a>\u00a0blog posts.
